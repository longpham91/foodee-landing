                </p>
                <p>To this end, we’ve described our practices and policies when it comes to your information below. By visiting, accessing or using the Foodee website (Foodee.io), mobile applications and API and all associated services, features and content (“Service” or “Services”), you acknowledge that:</p>
                <p>
                  &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have read and accept the practices and policies described in this Privacy Policy.<br />
                  &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have read and agree to be bound by our Terms of Service<br />
                  &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are over 13 years of age. (This Service is not targeted towards children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect information about children under the age of 13.

                </p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy covers Foodee’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that you provide or that we collect as described below. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Foodee does not own or control (including any third-party products or services used for logging into the Service or that are integrated with the Service), or to individuals that Foodee does not employ or manage.</p>
                <h4>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO YOU COLLECT AND HOW WILL YOU USE IT?</h4>
                <p>In order to provide the Foodee Service to you and improve your experience as described below, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
                <h4>Information You Choose to Provide to Us</h4>
                <p>We collect the following types of information on our servers only when you optionally choose to provide it to us by filling out a form, accepting a request for permission or taking some other explicit action:</p>
                <p>
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Private Profile Information</i>: In order to take advantage of certain Foodee features and enable us to contact you for the purposes described below, you can optionally create a Foodee account (your “Account”) by providing an email address and creating a password or by logging in using a third party service such as Facebook (your “Account Information”). If you log in using a third party service such as Facebook, the email address that you used to register with that third party service may be used to create your Account, and a password unique to Foodee may be generated for you, which you can change at any time. Passwords are stored using industry standard methods. Your actual password is never stored or visible to Foodee, its agents or employees at any time. Your email address will never be displayed to other users of the Service (unless you separately include it in any public information you provide, which we do not recommend).<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Third Party Connections</i>: In order to facilitate sharing of information between services and find friends who have registered for Foodee, you can connect third party services (such as Facebook and Twitter) using the secure, industry standard connection methods provided by these third parties. When you make a connection between your Foodee account and one of these third party services, the third party service may share certain information about you with Foodee.  These third parties never reveal your passwords to us and are responsible for informing you about what information they will share with Foodee. We will never post content to your third party profiles unless you’ve chosen to enable us to do so by accepting the appropriate request for permission, checking a box or taking some other explicit action.<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Payment Information</i>: We do not directly collect or store any payment information at this time, but may use third party services such as PayPal to enable you to purchase Foodee-related products or services. These Terms of Service do not cover third parties’ handling of Personal Information, so if you use these third party services, be sure to review their terms of service and privacy policies.<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Your Contacts</i>: In order to find friends who have registered for Foodee, you can optionally upload contact information from your mobile device by using the Find Contacts feature (if provided) and accepting the appropriate request for permission or prompt. We do not store this information, and never associate it with your Account or other Personal Information.<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Your Current Location</i>: In order to find nearby content more easily and receive targeted information, you can opt into sharing your mobile device or web browser’s location by accepting the appropriate permission or prompt. We never associate your current location with your account information.
                </p>
                <p>You can choose not to provide us with any of the information above, but may not be able to take advantage of certain features without creating an Account or providing the appropriate information.</p>
                <h4>Public Information You Choose to Provide to Us</h4>
                <p>Once you’ve created an Account, you can optionally choose to contribute or create the following types of information in accordance with our Terms of Service, which in this document we will refer to as, “Public Information.”</p>
                <p>
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Public Profile Information</i>: When registering or after registering, you can optionally enter in other public profile information such as a public display name, city, and bio. You can also upload a public profile photo.<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Public Photos</i>: You can select individual photos to upload, tag with information including the location where the photo was taken, and share publicly on Foodee per our Terms of Service. When you upload a photo, any associated metadata your camera might have embedded into that photo, such as the date taken or place taken, may be uploaded as well.<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Public Content</i>: You can create other types of content, such as reviews, ratings, pins and comments, which may be displayed publicly along with associated metadata such as date and time created.
                </p>
                <h4>Technical and Usage Information Collected Automatically</h4>
                <p>In order to understand how our Service is being used and to make it better, we also automatically receive, store and log certain types of technical and usage information whenever you interact with our Service. Information of this sort includes:</p>
                <p>
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Technical information about your browser and mobile device</i>: This information is used in the aggregate to help us optimize the Service for common browsers and devices.<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Usage information, such as the pages you request, searches you conduct and the features and emails from Foodee that you interact with</i>: This information is used in an aggregate form to generate statistics about how the Service is being used and to target advertising and communications (as further described under “Partners and Advertisers”, below), but is never shared in any form that could be reasonably used to identify you personally.<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>IP address, cookies, tokens and device identifiers</i>: These are alphanumeric identifiers that help us to distinguish between unique browsers and devices in order to avoid showing you the same information twice, keep you logged into Foodee, prevent duplicate actions, prevent duplicate coupon redemptions and improve your experience. You can learn more about cookies below.<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Crashes and error reports</i>: If you encounter a crash or error while using our Service, we may generate a crash report that includes technical, usage and, if you are logged in, your Account information so that we can diagnose and potentially prevent the problem in the future.<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use third party tools to collect this information on our behalf, including, Google Analytics.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>WILL FOODEE SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</h4>
                <p>While we may use and share your Public Information with third parties as permitted by our Terms of Service and you should only upload Public Information if you’re comfortable with all of these terms, we will never share any other Personal Information with third parties, except in the following scenarios or with your explicit consent:</p>
                <p>
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Agents, Including Employees, Contractors and Service Providers</i>: To achieve the purposes described above, we employ the services of individuals (such as employees, contractors and lawyers) and companies (such as consultants and service providers such as a push notification delivery service) to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share certain information with them in order to provide products or services to you. However, our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us in providing the service to you as described in this Privacy Policy.<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Change of Control</i>: In the event that all or a substantial portion of the assets, business or stock of Foodee are acquired by, merged with or transferred to another party, or in the event that Foodee goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, your information would be one of the assets that is transferred to or acquired by the third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Foodee or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.<br />
                    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Protection of Foodee and Others</i>: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Foodee, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. That said, any legal defenses or objections you may have to a third party’s request for your information, including a government, still apply.
                </p>
                <p>We will not share your Personal Information with the following parties without your explicit consent:</p>
