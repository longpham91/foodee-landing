        <p>First words, thank you so much for YOUR overwhelming support and valuable feedback for Foodee! Over the last few months we've poured our hearts and souls into this first public beta release, we're very happy with it and are confident that you will be too. </p>

        <p>One Big Announcement is that we are rebranding ourselves from Foodee to Munchee with a brand new logo. You can continue support us by visiting our new website <a href="http://munchee.io" target="_blank">munchee.io</a></p>
